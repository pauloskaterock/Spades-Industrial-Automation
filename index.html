    <h2>
        Let's talk a little about automation
    </h2>
    <p>To understand what <b>industrial automation</b> industrial means, we can look at the history of the industry over the years. More and more technology is advancing to improve production techniques.

        The use of more sophisticated machines in the production process is part of industrial automation. This has been happening in many segments, such as energy generation and distribution, transportation, product manufacturing, etc.
        
        One of its main objectives is to have more autonomy in the manufacturing processes, in addition to reducing the time of production of goods. This is a concept linked to industry 4.0, known as the fourth industrial revolution.
        
        This is because technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing are being much more explored by companies. In this way, we can understand what industrial automation does and its importance for development.<br>
    </p>

        <b>History of industrial automations</b>
        Automation starts from the moment when humanity replaces manual production methods and starts to put machines in their place. In the 18th century, the first semi-automatic devices were created.

        However, it was only in the 20th century, around the 1950s, that this concept became widespread in manufacturing, with fully automated machines. That's when many activities performed manually started to be done with the use of technology.

        This helped to increase production, making more goods in less time and without losing quality. After the Second World War, technology evolved even further, and the first numerically controlled machines were created, in addition to control systems.

        In the 1970s came computers, which had the function of controlling large automation systems. Soon, they were replaced by a more advanced machine, the Programmable Logic Controller. This was specially designed for industrial processes.

        Finally, with the arrival of the 1990s came the advance in computer technology with high processing capacity. This enabled the systems to become more efficient, as well as faster and more reliable. The production increased its scale and reduced costs, which generated more profit for the companies.<br>
